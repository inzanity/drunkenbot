3.	Gameplay

3.1	Overview
Basically Avalance: Battle over Platonia is a real time strategy (RTS) game. As usually in this genre, it includes everything from resource management to building up a military base and fighting the enemies. However, it has a whole new unit control and combat system. Instead of building an army, each side has to build massive war machines. These machines, known as mechs, are provided with the highest technology available, making only one of them worth of an army. As the whole war is wrapped around these machines and their technology, controlling the machine becomes an essential part of the game.

3.2	Gameplay description
From the strategical point of view, game is about gathering and managing resources, building a base, developing technologies and constructing the war machines. This is called the RTS mode. Player observes the world from top-down perspective. Only small part of the map fits to the screen, and the screen can be scrolled to view different areas of the map. Minimap can be used to get the general idea of the whole map. Unknown areas are shown as black, and have to be explored before seeing them. Areas far from buildings and units are covered by fog (fog of war). Enemy units can't be seen under the fog, but the rest of the map is seen as it was before.

There are three types of resources - electric power, metals and chemicals. Metals and chemicals for the industry can be collected from the rich occurrences of the otherwise bare ground by building distribution channels. Electricity can be produced with nuclear factories or from night storms by storing energy from the lighnings. Electricity is needed to maintain the functioning of the base. Mech contains internal source of power, and doesn't need resources in order to operate. Metals and chemicals are needed for buildings, machines, technologies and upgrades. Buildings and technologies may also require other buildings and technologies (see 3.3.2).
Simple commands can be given to mechs from RTS mode. These commands and their execution depends on the AI technology level of the mech. Mech without AI technology has to be controlled by hand, and it doesn't have any ability to avoid obstacles. On the other hand, mech provided with the highest AI technology is able to function with just one attack or defence command.

Full control of the mechs happens from the first person perspective (FPS mode). Instead of giving commands, player is able to operate the mech as accurately as possible. This includes moving, turning, aiming, weapon selection, firing and some other actions (see 3.3.1). Most of the important battles are made in FPS mode.

3.3	Rules
This chapter explains the rules and core mechanics of the game. Implementation details are not covered here. All constants and properties required for balancing the game are left outside.

3.3.1	Mech properties and actions
Mech has several properties affecting the gameplay. For example speed, hitpoints, weapons and other available technologies. See 3.3.3 for more detailed explanation of technologies.

From RTS mode, following commands can be given to mech:
	- Move
	- Stop
	- Patrol
	- Select weapon
	- Attack to target or use special weapon
	- Build power distribution system (see 3.2.2.5)

Mech can be fully controlled in FPS mode. This includes:
	- Moving forward
	- Moving backward
	- Turning
	- Turning the upper part of the mech, including vision and weapons
	- Select weapon
	- Attack or use special weapon
	- Build power distribution system

Mech has following automatic operation modes (enabled by AI technologies, see 3.3.3):
	- Manual mode
	- Autoaim mode
	- Autofire mode
	- Scout mode
	- Attack mode
	- Defence mode

3.3.2	Buildings and technology tree
Game contains one set of buildings and technologies for player to use. However, different sets are used for enemies in single player game. These sets is called technology trees. Technology tree consists of buildings, and dependence relationships between buildings and technologies. Because technology trees are fully configurable by tools (see 7.3.1), and have to be balanced by tweaking, they are not defined in this document. However, there are several buildings and relationships common to all technology trees. Each building is defined by following properties:
	- Cost in metals
	- Cost in chemicals
	- Power consumption
	- Hitpoints
	- Collision rectangles
	- Audiovisual appearance
	- Depencence relationships

3.3.2.1	Command center
Command center is the main building of the game. It is required to build any other buildings. Resource distribution channels (see 3.2.2.2) must be connected to the command center in order to deliver resources.

3.3.2.2	Resource gathering
Each technology tree needs a buildings for producing energy. These buildings use negative power consumption property to indicate power producing. Each of these buildings increase the power storage capacity. When running with low power, resource gathering and defence systems are working slower. Additional flag (and possibly animations) are needed for buildings producing energy from lightnings.

Distribution channels are needed for every technology tree as well. They are sort of a pipes from Command center to the metal or chemical occurrences. For collision checking, channel is considered as rough terrain (see movement area, 3.3.3). Channel consists of blocks, but visual appearance is a contunuous pipe. Two channels can be connected, and it's possible to have branches. Block of the channel can be destroyed as any other building, and unconnected channel doesn't deliver resources.

3.3.2.3	Dock yard
Place for building, reparing and upgrading mechs. When mech is ordered to move to the Dock yard, it walks to the center of the building. After that it can be repaired or upgraded, if any upgrades are available and it has all required upgrades installed. Implementation note: repairing the mech should be much cheaper than building a new one.

3.3.2.4	Defence of the base
Each technology tree has special kind of buildings for defence, which are automatically firing at enemies nearby. Weapon is defined by additional property. Another important defence building is wall, cheap building with high hitpoints. While it's not necessary for all technology trees, it should be very common.

3.3.2.5	Power distribution system
Buildings can only be constructed close to the other buildings. One action of the mech is build a power distribution system. This action is enabled, if all requirements for the building are fulfilled. Power distribution system makes it possible to build distant expansion bases. These are important for the gameplay, since the player is forced to scout for additional enemy resource gathering bases and defence centers.

3.3.3	Technologies
To enable different kind of strategies, game contains four different technology branches. These branches are not exclusive, but having the most advanced technologies usually requires developing the whole branch. Each technology has cost in metals, cost in chemicals and research time.

3.3.3.1	Movement branch
	- Movement area
		- Basic movement, plain terrain (default)
		- Advanced movement, rough terrain
		- Landing jets (maximum weight requirement)
	- Moving speed
		- Certain number of speed upgrades
			- The impact gets smaller and smaller with every upgrade
			- Weight of the mech has a linear drawback to the speed
	- Turning upper body
		- Certain number of upgrades
			- Linear impact to the maximum turning angle
			- Maximum of 180 degrees, which enables full turning
3.3.3.2	Attack branch
	- Collection of weapons. Example collection could look like this:
		- Chain saw
		- Minigun
		- Missile
		- Laser
		- Landmine
		- Bazooka
		- Homing missile
		- EMP Shockwave

3.3.3.3	Defence branch
	- Armour
		- Certain number of piercing armour upgrades
		- Certain number of explosion armour upgrades
			- Both damage types can be reduced by some percentage value
			- The impact gets smaller and smaller with every upgrade (of that type)
	- Defence mechanism for homing missiles
	- EMP defence system
	- Landmine detector

3.3.3.4	Technology branch
	- Radar (spinning radar with short radius and delayed detection)
	- Machine vision (detect enemy mechs, usually required for pathfinding and autoaiming)
	- Path finding
	- Advanced radar (wider radius and instant detection)
	- Map scanner (makes the whole map explored, doesn't remove the fog of war)
	- Auto aim (automaticly moves the crosshair)
	- Advanced machine vision (detect technology level of the enemy mech)
	- Tactical AI (enables automatic scout, attack and defence modes for mech)

3.3.3.5	Upgrades
When technology research has been completed, mechs aren't automatically able to use it. All mechs have to be upgraded one by one to get the advantages of the new technology (see 3.3.2.3). Some upgrades (weapons, shields) may increase the weight of the mech.

In addition to the technology upgrades, size of the mech can be upgraded. Each technology tree defines certain number of size upgrades. Size has a linear impact to hitpoints.

3.3.4	Weapons
Like buildings and technology trees, game contains one set of weapons for player to use, but different sets are used for enemies in single player game. Weapons are fully configurable by tools (see 7.3.1), and need to be tweaked for balancing. Each weapon has following properties:
	- Technology cost in metals
	- Technology cost in chemicals
	- Technology research time
	- Range (of ranged OR melee weapon)
	- Explosion/effect radius
	- Fire rate
	- Ammunition speed
	- Piercing damage
	- Explosion damage
	- Weapon type (legal combination of ranged, melee, homing, landmine and continual effect)
	- Time (for homing missile to try, landmine to activate or effect to last)
	- Weight
	- Required mech size

3.4	Goals, victory and end conditions

3.4.1	Goals
Primary goal is to eliminate enemies by destroying all of their buildings. This can be achieved by developing powerful war machines, mechs, and defeating enemies in a battle. As simple as that might sound, the way to the victory may not be easy. Being the best requires both tactical and strategical skills, as well as fast reactions. Don't count on your luck, there is no room for accidents.

3.4.2	Subgoals
To complete single player mission, player has to accomplish mission objectives. Each mission may include several types of objectives, and the objectives can change during the mission. Each objective may a have time limit. Player can be rewarded for accomplishing a subgoal with resources, mechs, technologies, upgrades or even buildings, and there may be optional subgoals (just to reward the player). Subgoal types are:
	- Build/develop something (building, technology, mech, upgrade)
	- Eliminate enemies (see 3.4.1)
	- Survive (time limit needed)
	- Keep control of the target area (no enemy units let inside, time limit needed)
	- Destroy targets (buildings or mechs)
	- Get to the target (area, building or mech)

3.4.3	End conditions
Victory can be achieved by accomplishing all the goals. In that case, game is ended instantly. Failing any goal will cause defeat. This will end the game in single player game, but in multiplayer game, if implemented, player is just dropped out of the game. In addition to victory and defeat, there is no scoring system.

3.5	User interface

3.5.1	Controls

3.5.1.1	RTS mode controls
In RTS mode, everything can be done using the mouse. Screen is scrolled by moving cursor to the side of the screen or with arrow keys. One building or mech can be selected at the time by left clicking it, and it can be unselected by left clicking empty map or pressing esc. Shortcut can be binded to selected object by pressing ctrl + number key. Pressing binded number key will select that object later. If nothing is selected, all buildings are shown as a list of buttons in the Action list (see 3.5.2). Pushing the button will make the mouse cursor look like the building, and the building can be started by selecting (left clicking) an empty location for it. Building action can be cancelled by right clicking anywhere or pressing esc. If building is already started, it can be cancelled by selecting the building and left clicking "Cancel" button from the action menu or pressing esc.

If building is selected, all technologies and upgrades from that building are shown as a list of buttons in the action list. Buttons are disabled if the technology or upgrade is not available. When button is left clicked, item is added to the action queue (see 3.5.2). If upgrade can be done several times (armour, speed, upper body turning and size upgrades, see 3.3.3), pushing the button again adds another upgrade to the queue.

If the mech is selected, all actions and automatic operation modes are shown as a list of buttons in action list. After selecting move, patrol, attack or building the power distribution system, destination of the action has to be selected by left clicking on the map. These actions can be cancelled by right clicking anywhere, or pressing esc. If shift key is being pressed while selecting the action, action will be appended to the queue. Otherwise selected action will be the only action in the queue. Patrol is an exception to this rule, anything appended to the queue will remove patrol from it (as it lasts "forever").

Every action in the game has a shortcut key. For example, pressing 's' when mech is selected will stop the mech. Items from the queue can be cancelled and removed by left clicking the item. Queue has a fixed length, and new actions can't be selected while queue is full. Player can change to the FPS mode by double clicking the mech, pressing enter when mech is selected or pressed binded number key of the selected mech (after selection).

3.5.1.2	FPS mode controls
Controlling the mech requires both the mouse and the keyboard. Upper body can be turned using mouse. Pressing 'w' key moves the mech forwards, and 's' moves it backwards. Turning of the mech can be done with 'a' and 'd' keys. Left mouse button is used for shooting, right mouse button for changing weapon. There are shortcut keys for automatic operation modes, and for building the power distribution system. If scout, attack or defence automatic operation mode is selected, moving the mech manually returns it to autofire mode. Pressing esc or binded shortcut number returns the game to the RTS mode. The FPS mode controls given are default settings and can be customized from the game menu to fit personal preferences.

3.5.3	Feedback
Few lines of text can be shown on the screen. Following information or warnings can be displayed:
	- Player is trying to do something illegal
	- Building or mech is under attack
	- Building, technology or upgrade has completed
	- Warning for low power
	- Information related to mission objectives
	- Messages written by players
Sounds are also used to give feedback to the player.

3.6	Modes and other features

3.6.1	Multiplayer experience
If multiplayer capabilities are done, there will be a game server, that will allow the players to find opponents and talk about the game. They can also exchange messages during the game (see 3.5.3), but the game server allows the aftermath and pre-game boasting.

3.6.2	Saving and resuming
In single player game, player is able to skip passed levels and continue playing the level where he was before. Game can not be saved during the mission.

3.7	Levels
The levels will support the plot. Transition between levels will be filled with little written stories, that keep the player interested and motivated, even while the game itself is not running. In some levels the player is given only a mech in the beginning, and the goal set to getting to certain place, where there's no need, nor ways to build anything. Then there are levels, where only the command center is given and the player needs to build his way to reach objectives.
