6.	The Game World

6.1	Overview
The world in the game is static, pre-defined and three dimensional. The worlds gets dimmer in the nighttime, and lighter in the daytime. In the night the weather gets stormy and lightnings can be used for electricity, but also reveal the location of your base. The amount of lightnings alters on different levels.

6.2	Key locations
Key locations in the game are the locations where resources can be extracted. As the resources are critical for building and advancing in the game, the party commanding most resources will have an advantage.

6.3	Travel
The characters of the game walk around in the world. They can be moved either by commanding them to go to a certain location, or by controlling them in a first person-view.

6.4	Scale
The world is rather limited, about 2 by 2 kilometres wide.

6.5 Physics
Physics in the game are rather simple, there is no flying or jumping. Bigger objects move slower, and objects of certain size cannot be made to get down a steep drop.

6.6 Time
The game takes place in distant future, on a different planet, where days are shorter than on the Earth.

6.7	Society/culture
Societies and cultures do not appear in the game per se, but they have certain role in the storyline.
