7.1	Enabling technologies
Platform for the game can be any modern PC, with a 3D accelerator installed. Controlling of the mech is ideally done with a joystick, but at least keyboard and mouse are required for playing. If network-gaming is implemented, it will require a network connection with lag small enough to allow good gaming experience. Since it is a real-time game, major lag will cause big problems.

7.2	Level editor
Level editor needs minimally to be able to define a heightfield for the landscape and starting locations. For storyline missions, there is also a need for scripting ability and action points. The scripting facility needs commands like attack, move, give units, win and lose, with the ability to attach these to action points and/or timers)
