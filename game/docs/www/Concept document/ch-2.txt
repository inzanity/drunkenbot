2.	Overview

2.1	Core concept
The game is a combination of real time strategy and first person shooter. The goal is to free the planet from evil by destroying it. The evil has its own forces, which try to prevent this. The game allows the player to explore the world in a first person view, while also allowing building, thus modifying the game world.

2.2	Technological and social environment
The game is played on a normal PC-computer, against the computer. In future versions, multiplayer support via network might be implemented.

2.3	Setting 
The game is placed in a distant future on an inhabitable planet, where all human lifeforms must stay indoors, and everything outdoors is done with robots.

2.4	Look and feel
Interface of the game will look rather metallic, since metal is the most important thing in the game. The world in the game will be red-ish to give an illusion about inhabitable atmosphere. In the night the game will go quite dark. The music will be quite massive, to reflect the gigantic size of the battle-mechs, with some electro-style for the futuristic influence.
