4.	Game characters

4.1	Character design
[Describe game characters properties: AI, traits, and behavior. What is the purpose of each character? In what ways can the player modify characters' properties?]

4.1.1	Player characters
There are no mechs for special purposes, all the mechs are basically the same, only differing in size and weaponry. The mechs can do nothing on their own at first, but with enabling technologies (see 3.3.3) they can find their way to the other side on their own, or shoot enemy mechs on sight.

4.1.2	Nonplayer characters

4.1.2.1	Enemies
Enemy characters will shoot player characters on sight, they only retreat if scripted so in the level. When they are not activated (by script action or noticing player), they do nothing.

4.1.2.2	Friends and allies
Allies do not interfere with player characters, unless scripted.

4.1.2.3	Neutral
Neutral units either just hang around, or shoot everybody on sight, depending on level settings. They may be used as script elements to "tell" the story.
