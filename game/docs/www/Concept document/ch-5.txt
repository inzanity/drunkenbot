**PREMISE**

Interstellar travel has been possible for decades now due to the advanced technology of the human race. Competition over resources and warfare have left the planet Earth and spread over the whole universe, where fierce wars are being fought over the control of many star systems. Large intergalactical corporations employ millions of people all around the universe. War industry is living its brightest time of the history.

Infiny is the leading Technology Corporation in the galaxy of the Milky Way. It produces everything from war machines to space stations. Although it's the single biggest weapon manufacturer with good reputation, Infiny's operations have spawned rumours of suspicious and unethical methods that is uses to achieve it's goals. On it's way to financial leadership of the galaxy, Infiny has created many enemies. A lot of people is ready to strike this huge techo-giant down with any means necessary. The most organized rebellion group, Furies, has small branches in star systems near the center of the Milky Way. On Proxima, which is a double starred system with five planets, there has been peaceful existence of mining communities for a long time. Only one of the five planets has life on it. This planet is full of different materials, such as iron and titanium. Combined with average conditions to mine these resources, this planet has woken the interest of Infiny to establish bases all around the surface. This planet is called Platonia.

Because Platonia has no atmosphere, no human can walk on the surface without proper equipment. And because of the difficult weather conditions, such as huge lighting storms at nights and occasional burning-hot sunbursts at days, humans have created a better way of building things and moving around the planet, Robots. They are used in everything. First of there robots, Mech One, was build twenty years ago. It was made for walking only and was small in size. As time passed by, these Mechs became larger and their usage expanded rapidly. Not only could they be used in walking great distances, but also were equipped with weapons and instruments. It didn't take much time for Furies, the rebellion group, to find out that these Mechs, created with Infinys technology, could easily be modified to help their own cause. For five years now, Furies has caused a lot of damage to Infiny with small attacks on it's bases and mining facilities. As the attacks has grown bigger and bigger, Infiny has become more determined to end the existence of Furies on the planet Platonia of the Proxima system. Infiny created an anti rebellion group to take control of everything. Furies and Infiny has been fighting ever since.

As the clashes between Infiny and Furies turned huge from time to time, the room for other businesses than Infinys own to prosper became almost impossible. Branches of Furies were always hiding and Infinys heavily armed military- and mining-bases took control of the whole planet. There was only one region on the planet that had not been spoiled by the war and an independent firm called Avalance was still alive and breathing there. Because of this war on Platonia and the tremendous amount of Infiny force, Avalance was also on the brink of extinction. Avalance had to make a choice between fusion with Infinys war machinery or joining forces with Furies and fight a hopeless fight against this Corporate giant. The choice was not going to be easy.

**NOW**

Avalance started to think it's possibilites. Filled with good and politically neutral workers and managers, Avalance decieded to take the chance of surviving on it's own and see where it would go, even though chances of survival against Infiny were little. Figting between Infiny and Furies continued and some of it took place near Avalances regions. Suprisingly after a while Avalance was able to create a small but well defenced region, where the war was not able to spread.

Avalance heard of a great battle that was claimed to be the death of the rebellion force. After the battle Avalance was contacted by the leader of the Furies. They wanted to settle in Avalances region and share knowledge of technology and teach ways to bring down Infiny. They claimed that for years, Infiny had been creating technology, that would chance the way wars are fought. A new generation of Mechs, that would be superior both in size and force. For this technology, a special metal is being developed from very rare metals, found only on certain regions of Platonia. Infiny had to be stopped, before this deadly Mech technology was complited.

Avalance started to fight Infiny with the aid from Furies. After huge battles and many victories and close calls, Avalance was able to reach Infinys main base on Platonia. Although managings break through Infinys defence, Avalance was in front a terrible challenge. Infiny had complited their research on the feared technology and a huge Mech called DreadForce had been created secretly on their laboratories. Avalance was faced with the biggest challenge of all: to bring down DreadForce!

After staggering defeats against DreadForce Avalance was sure that nothing would be enough to destroy this ultimate Mech. DreadForce moved base after base closer to Avalances operation center and all hope had almost faided. At the final battle on the gates of Avalances home base, DreadForce sustained great damage and was forced to retreat. In fear of DreadForces capabilities to repair itself, Avalance was forced to attack rapidly against wounded DreadForce. With swift moves and brilliant strategy Avalance was able to destroy DreadForce and soon gained control of planet Platonia.

Avalance won the fight on Platonia, but the war had only begun...
