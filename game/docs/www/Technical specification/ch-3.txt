3.1	RTS-mode
3.1.1	Enemies and neutrals

	- <b>Performing</b>: When enemies or neutrals are sighted, they attack you immediately or retreat, depending on the situation.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: When an enemy or an neutral game object is close enough to a players object it starts to follow scripted routine or calculates the situation based on current strength etc. wheter to attack or retreat.

3.1.2	On-game messages

	- <b>Performing</b>: Every important message in game is printed on the bottom-left corner of screen and stays there for a while. Applies to FPS mode also.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: There are certain events on game, which are important enough to be shown to player. These events send messages to In-Game Message system that prints correct information to screen.

3.1.3	Map

	- <b>Performing</b>: The whole map is shown here. Clicking here with left mouse button you can change the place of top-down view or use actions of selected objects directly to a certain place.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: The whole game world is projected here like it's seen to player. If CDirectInput class tells that left mouse button is pressed on top this map, correct place of the place in the world is calculated and left mouse button message is generated to object or the game depending on if there is any object selected etc.

3.1.4	Resources

	- <b>Performing</b>: Your available resources are displayed in the top-right corner. When collecting resources from sources you can see the increasing resources immediately.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: Amount of metal and chemicals are stored in variables and the overall and used amount of power is calculated from all the building objects and energy generator objects preferences.

3.1.5	Environmental occurrences

	- <b>Performing</b>: Day and night changes is real time. In day time sunlight provides all the light needed. At nights mechs and bases have additional lights to enable seeing in the darkness. Every now and then at nights lightning strikes down from the sky. Lightnings can be captured with lighning power station thus creating additional energy.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: When game time variable increases to match definion of night time, game starts to calculate random occurrences for lightings with random starting and finishing points (finishing point of course dependant on starting point). If Starting point is near enough to a lightning power station object, finishing point goes automatically to the object, but if not, the lightning strikes down randomly.

3.2.1	Radar

	- <b>Performing</b>: When the radar technology is developed, the mechs will get an on screen radar, that will scan the mechs surroundings. The radar will show any mechs in the vicinity, at first if they're in the direction of the radar "beam", and with more advanced technology they are detected if they're near enough.
	- <b>Implementation</b>: If the mech has radar technology, it's distance and direction from other mechs are calculated. If they're close enough and at the direction of the radar (for the less advanced radar), they will be shown as dots on the radar.
