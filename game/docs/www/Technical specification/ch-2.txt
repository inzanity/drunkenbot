2.1	RTS Functions
2.1.1	Selecting an object

*	Performing: Move mouse on top an object (etc. building or mech) and click left mouse button once.
*	Implementation: CDirectInput class tells that left mouse button was pressed and supplies the coordinates, which are used to determine if there is an object underneath to be selected. If there is, 'selected'-variable is updated.

2.1.2	Unselecting an object

*	Performing: While an object is selected, move mouse cursor to empty place and click left mouse button once. Also pressing 'esc' on keyboard unselects object.
*	Implementation: CDirectInput class tells that left mouse button was pressed and supplies the coordinates, which are used to determine if there is an object underneath to be selected. If there isn't, 'selection'-variable is cleared. Same happens if CDirectInput class supplies keyboard input 'esc'.

2.1.3	Binding a selection

*	Performing: While an object is selected, hold 'Ctrl' button down and choose a number to bind the object to.
*	Implementation: CDirectInput class tells if 'Ctrl' is down and a number is pressed. After that 'selected'-variable is checked. If not empty, it's contents are copied to 'bind[number]'-variable.

2.1.4	Referring to bound object

*	Performing: In any state of the game, if an object is bound to a certain number, pressing this number selects the object immediately.
*	Implementation: If CDirectInput class tells that a number was pressed, 'bind[number]'-variable is checked, and if not empty it's contents is copied to 'selected'-variable.

2.1.5	Building a building

*	Performing: Move mouse curson on top a building you want to build and press left button once or press the quick button on keyboard which refers to the building in question. Then move mouse cursor to the place you want to put the building and press left mouse button once. Then wait for the building to complete.
*	Implementation: CDirectInput class tells that if left mouse button is pressed and gives the coordinates, which are used to determine if the cursor was on top of a building-icon in action list. If was, then the mouse cursor is chanced to a appropriate building. A correct keyboard button does the same thing (checked from CDirectInput). When left mouse button is pressed again, the coordinates tell where the building is set to be built. If there was no collisions with other CGameObj-variables and the coordinates are inside the 'energisized' region a building of CGameObj class is created on those coordinates.
