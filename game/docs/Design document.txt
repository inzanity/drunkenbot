[Note: this document should be as extensive as necessary. The purpose of a game design document is to communicate an overall vision of the game for the development team to implement. Implementation details such as formulas should not be described in this document. You may insert pictures where appropriate. You do not have to write something to every paragraph in this template if it is not necessary for describing the game concept.]
