Robot specifications.

The purpose of this document is to specify abilities and disabilities of the robots
and define basic rules of controlling them.

Robots are acting in simplified tile based environment. Tile is a rectangular block
with a constant size, namely 100 units/side. Block can be either wall, obstacle or an emty block.

The robot is equipped with quite inadvanced mobilizing utilities, and it can only move
in four directions (forward, backwards, left or right). Moving speed is constant, 25 units/round
forward and 10 units/round to other directions. In order to change direction, the robot is able to
turn 18 degrees/round.

For input the robot uses a radar cabable of scanning an sector of 90 degrees with infinite radius.
The radar can scan areas behind an obstacle, while unveiling it's existence, but not thorough walls.
Besides the radar, the robot has multiple sound sensors that are used with an accurate timer to get
the direction to the source of the sound.
